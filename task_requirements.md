# Task requirments for both front and backend tasks

## FRONTEND STAGE 5 TASK

**Task 1:** Chrome Extension Plugin for Screen Recording and Sharing

*Objective:* Create a Chrome Extension plugin that can record a user's screen and send the recorded content to a specific online location (endpoint). The design specifications can be found here: [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/file/SfVZFkRDgF1DbQR86eovnN/HelpMeOut?type=design&node-id=190-2117&mode=design&t=9P5048wPGKKv3vfO-0).

**Requirements:**
  1. Implement the design exactly as provided. Ensure that all pages match the design precisely.
  2. The plugin must work seamlessly on desktop.
  3. Create a mechanism to record the user's screen.
  4. Develop a feature to submit the recorded content to a specific endpoint.
  5. Make it user-friendly and easy to use.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. The plugin accurately captures and records the user's screen as per the design specifications.
  2. All pages in the design provided in Figma are implemented pixel-perfectly within the plugin.
  3. The plugin functions flawlessly on both desktop and mobile devices, with no significant visual or usability issues.
  4. Users can initiate and stop screen recording with clear controls.
  5. Recorded screen content is properly compressed and submitted to the specified endpoint.
  6. The submission process is error-free, and users receive confirmation upon successful submission.
  7. Any potential issues or errors are gracefully handled, and users receive appropriate feedback.

## BACKEND STAGE 5 TASK

**Task 2:**
###### Pair yourself with one or more FE devs in your team.

You will develop the BE for their Chrome task.
This backend will receive the video they send, save it to disk and render the page where the video can be played. Do not add authentication. This is an individual task, not a team task. Have your own repo where you work on this. You do not need to use a DB for this, except you want to.
